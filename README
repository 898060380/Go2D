To use this framework, you will need to install SDL 1.3, SDL_ttf and SDL_image.

###Windows Users - read this!###
If you don't want to spend time compiling SDL, but just start on your game right away, you can download go2d_windows_bin.zip for compiled versions of all needed DLL files and the two Go libraries
